<h1>Executive Summary</h1> 

The server has hardcoded details present within a public facing email chain. Those credentials can be abused to get access to an admin portal and from there a reverse shell can be initiated. Once on the box itself, the ssh key infastructure is vulnerable to injection. An attacker can inject his own ssh key pair and move laterally from there. Once on as a regular user, credentials can be extracted from easily accessible log files. User can also escalate to root through sudo abuse of the apt-get program.
